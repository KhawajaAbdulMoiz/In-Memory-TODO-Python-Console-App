# 🧠 In-Memory Python Console App

A **hackathon Phase 1 project** built using **Python**, structured with **Spec-Kit Plus**, and enhanced with **Qwen AI** for intelligent behavior — all running fully **in memory**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **console-based Python application** designed to demonstrate:
- Clean, spec-driven development
- Proper in-memory data handling
- Purposeful AI integration
- A scalable foundation for future phases

The application does **not** rely on databases or file storage — all data exists only during runtime.
