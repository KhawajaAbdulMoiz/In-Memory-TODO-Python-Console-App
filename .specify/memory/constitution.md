# Todo In-Memory Python Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code, specifications, plans, and documentation must be generated by AI coding agents (Claude or equivalent). No human manual coding is permitted under any circumstances. The development process must strictly follow the sequence: specification → implementation plan → task breakdown → AI implementation → refinement.

### II. Specification-Driven Development
Every feature and change must begin with a detailed specification document. Specifications must include clear acceptance criteria, error handling requirements, and interface definitions before any implementation begins. All specifications must be versioned and stored in the specs/history/ folder.

### III. In-Memory Data Storage
The application must store all tasks completely in memory with no persistence to files or databases. This constraint ensures simplicity and focuses development on core functionality rather than data management concerns.

### IV. Command-Line Interface
The application must provide a simple but user-friendly CLI with a loop-based interface accepting text commands. The interface must support all required features: add, view/list, update, delete, and mark complete/incomplete tasks.

### V. Zero External Dependencies
The application must use only Python standard library modules with no external dependencies. This ensures maximum portability and eliminates dependency management complexity.

### VI. Clean Code Standards
All code must adhere to PEP 8 standards, include appropriate docstrings, use clear naming conventions, and maintain separation of concerns. Code quality is paramount for AI-generated code to ensure maintainability and readability.

## Required Features
The application must implement exactly these 5 features:
1. Add task (with title and description)
2. View/List all tasks (with ID, title, description, status)
3. Update task details by ID
4. Delete task by ID
5. Mark task as complete/incomplete

## Technology Requirements
- Python 3.13+ must be used for development
- UV must be used for project and virtual environment management
- All deliverables must be properly versioned and stored in the repository

## Required Artifacts
The following deliverables must exist in the repository:
- Project constitution (this document)
- Specifications history in specs/history/ folder
- Source code in src/ folder
- README.md with setup and run instructions
- Documentation of prompts, iterations, and learnings

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All code reviews and pull requests must verify compliance with these principles. Any amendments to this constitution require documentation of the change, approval process, and migration plan if needed.
